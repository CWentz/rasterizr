	///         contains extended operand description.  This dcl is currently not
	///         extended.
	///
	/// OpcodeToken0 is followed by 1 operand:
	/// (1) Operand, starting with OperandToken0, defining which CB slot (cb#[size])
	///     is being declared. (operand type: D3D10_SB_OPERAND_TYPE_CONSTANT_BUFFER)
	///     The indexing dimension for the register must be 
	///     D3D10_SB_OPERAND_INDEX_DIMENSION_2D, where the first index specifies
	///     which cb#[] is being declared, and the second (array) index specifies the size 
	///     of the buffer, as a count of 32-bit*4 elements.  (As opposed to when the 
	///     cb#[] is used in shader instructions, and the array index represents which 
	///     location in the constant buffer is being referenced.)
	///     If the size is specified as 0, the CB size is not known (any size CB
	///     can be bound to the slot).
	///
	/// The order of constant buffer declarations in a shader indicates their
	/// relative priority from highest to lowest (hint to driver).
